## Part 5: Natural Language Processing in Action - Chapter 11

This chapter discusses knowleadge graphs and information retrivial with the goal. The authors definition of a knowleadge graph is a flexible data structure designed to store knowledge. This allows for the model to extract meaningful information about a topic to essentially understand what it reads (Lane and Dyshel 2025). Below is a summary from the main topics in the text.  

- **Information Extraction from Natural Language**
At a high level, the way that the model can extract facts from the text is by parsing the text into entities and discovering the relations between them. A graph data structure is an appropriate data store for the knowledge graph, also called knowledge database. The nodes in the graph would are the entities, and the the edges represent the relations between entities. 


This topic would explore how named entity recognition (NER) helps extract essential information from text, identifying key entities like names, places, and organizations.



- **Semantic Structure Analysis** 
By focusing on dependency parsing, this topic can explain how sentences are broken down into their structural components to uncover the connections between words.


- **Building Knowledge Graphs**
